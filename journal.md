<p> - I'm excited to see Github on the list of major tech for this course. For many I'm sure there will be a learning curve using it, but I've been using it for 7 or so years. Im glad to see crosover from my COMP courses. I was hoping this class wpould link my computer science expiriance and my new focus on history, and it seems like I was correct. </p>
